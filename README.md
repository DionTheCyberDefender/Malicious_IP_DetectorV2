# Malicious_IP_DetectorV2
An upgraded version that serves a purpose of pulling IP data from the user's input and allowing the user to utilize multiple tools (AbuseIPDB &amp; VirusTotal) for their investigation in this version.

Once the user receives the output from the desired tool, they can then determine if the IP depicts any danger or if additional reseach is needed to assist with their decision.
