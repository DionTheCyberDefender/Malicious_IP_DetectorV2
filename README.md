# Malicious_IP_DetectorV2 👁👁🥂
An updated version that serves the purpose of pulling the user's IP input data while allowing them to utilize multiple tools (AbuseIPDB &amp; VirusTotal) for their investigation.

Once the user receives the output from the desired tool, they can then determine if the IP depicts any danger or if additional reseach is needed to assist with their decision.
